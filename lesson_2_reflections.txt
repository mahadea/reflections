What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  When you initialize a repository you take the contents of a directory and
  make them known to git.  It's the starting point to track changes to the
  files that make up that directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
  The staging area is an intermediate place.  It holds the objects that are
  added to the repository and tracks changes in them.  when a commit is
  issued git takes what's in the staging area and creates a snapshot in the
  respository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one
commit per logical change?
  By ensuring that all the files that were changed for that logical change
  are 'git add'ed before issuing a commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
  when i have a main project stream and want to keep it stable for interim
  demos and so on but also want to try some alternative coding approaches
  i will find using a branch beneficial.
  by using branches I can still have something solid that works properly
  but have the luxury of experimenting


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
  Diagrams help me know when branches were created and how many branches exist
  They show me if there are unreachable branches.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
  the diagram the way we do?
  When you merge branches together you can combine code changes made by
  different people working in parallel.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always
doing merges manually?
  Pro- makes it easier for programmer, reduces chances of mistakes, speeds
  up the process
  Con- could inadvertently overlay changes, cannot always figure out what
  programmer had in mind
