When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when I want to share my work with other people who can then clone my repository and make their contributions or if I am
likely to work on multiple computers then I can use git hub to check in and check out my code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If Git stays uptodate with remote then changes I have made locally that are not ready to be 'published' will get automatically pushed to remote as well.  So better to manually push and pull.
