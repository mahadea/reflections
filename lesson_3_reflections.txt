When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when I want to share my work with other people who can then clone my repository and make their contributions or if I am
likely to work on multiple computers then I can use git hub to check in and check out my code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If Git stays uptodate with remote then changes I have made locally that are not ready to be 'published' will get automatically pushed to remote as well.  So better to manually push and pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	fork is when you create a copy of a repository within github.  You would use fork when you want to work off an existing repository that someone else has created and you want to continue the parentage
	clone is when you make a copy of a repository from github to your PC.  you want to clone when you want to do some serious work that can only be done on the PC, typically programming/coding type activities
	branch is when you are working on your PC but want to try out things not directly related to what the main line of work is.
